Yesterday, I visited Sirs Andrew, A,B,C,D,Eleonore,F,G and Nancy. I asked Sir Andrew
who he was, and he answered impatiently: "exactly one of us is a Knight!"
Then I met Sir Bill who introduced me to his wife
and told me: "at most one of Sir Nancy
and Sir Hilary is a Knave."
"At least one of Sir Hilary
and I is a Knave," whispered Sir Eleonore.
Should I trust them?
